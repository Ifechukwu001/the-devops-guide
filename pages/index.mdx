# Welcome to The DevOps Guide

DevOps Guide is an open-source guide to provide you with an outline of skills needed to learn to get into DevOps. At the end of it you should have the technical knowledge of DevOps.

## Prerequisite

- Linux
- Networking
- Programming Fundamentals (Python)

I highly recommend some fundamental knowledge of Linux, Networking and Programming.
Checkout [Learn to Cloud Guide](https://learntocloud.guide) as it has some great resources and projects for these prerequisites.

## DevOps Engineers can be self-taught?

Yes, [here is how I did it.](https://youtu.be/nI8-qnSMY40)
